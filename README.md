DESCRIPTION:

The CIS Partners App is designed to meet the needs of B2B export-oriented companies with extensive product portfolios. It aims to address the challenges posed by complex PDF catalogs and Excel price lists by providing an efficient, digital solution. This app streamlines communication between the export company, overseas distributors, and end users. 

Key objectives include:

1. Simplifying product accessibility, making it easier for distributors and importers to find products, prices, and promotions quickly.
2. Customizing information and pricing for different users, catering to both end users and authorized partners.
3. Automating processes such as generating commercial offers, updating prices, managing promotions, handling technical requests, and optimizing order management.
4. Enhancing overall efficiency by reducing manual tasks typically performed by export managers.


FUNCTIONS:

For Unauthorized Users (End Users)
1. Virtual Product Catalog: Access to product information without prices.

For Authorized Users (Distributors/Importers)
1. Virtual Product Catalog: Provides authorized users with client-specific prices.
2. Promotions Management: Allows for the management of general promotions and unique, user-specific promotions.
3. Order Management: Facilitates adding items to the cart, creating orders (both standard and recommended products), and sending orders to the company.
